# Performing the tasks of the JavaScript module (Minutemen and Time. Promise) in the GOIT course.

## Color switcher
Create a script that, when the “Start” button is clicked, changes the background color to a random value once per second. When the “Stop” button is clicked, the background color stops changing and stops at the given color. The “Start” button is inactive as long as the color change is running.
## Countdown timer
Create a countdown timer script that counts down to a specific event set by the user in the checkbox.
## Promise generator
Create a script that, after submitting the form, will call the function as many times as the amount entered in the field. After each call, it passes to it the number of the created promise and the delay, taking into account the first delay and degree entered by the user.
